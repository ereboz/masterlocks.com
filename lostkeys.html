        <h3>I lost the keys for my padlock. Is it possible to obtain new keys?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                It may be possible to obtain replacement keys for your padlock ONLY if you know the key number. The key number is stamped on the original keys provided with your lock. If you do not know the key number, it is possible to obtain additional keys from a locksmith who can impression your lock. If you do know the key number, go to a locksmith or local hardware store to order keys. Please note that the locksmith will charge you a fee for this service. Not all Locksmiths, Hardware Stores or Home Centers offer this service; please phone ahead.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>I've lost the keys that came with my lock and I do not know my key number. Can I send my lock to Master Lock to have keys made?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Without the key number, there is no way for Master Lock to know which key will open your lock. There is no such thing as a "Master" key that will open all Master Lock products.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Can I buy additional keys for my lock directly from Master Lock?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Master Lock does not provide keys directly to consumers; however, you may take one of your keys to a local hardware store, home center or locksmith where they can cut duplicate keys. Please note that not every store will have the appropriate key blanks available. Please call ahead.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Can I order a new lock that will work with my existing key?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                It may be possible to order products that can be opened by an existing Master Lock key. Take your existing key and lock to a hardware store (Ace, True Value, etc.), locksmith or other outlet that sells Master Lock products. Ask them to order the product with the same key number that is on your key. Please call ahead, as not every retailer will provide this service.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Can Master Lock keep a record of my combination or key number for me?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Master Lock provides an exciting online tool called masterlockvault.com that allows you to store up to five combinations and/or key numbers in a secure database. You can access your combos 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>We lost both keys to our lock during a move. Now we are unable to get some important records out of storage. What should we do?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                If you did not record the key number, which was stamped on the original keys that came with your lock, it is not possible to obtain replacement keys. Contact your local hardware store/locksmith for removal. If you know the key number, a hardware store/locksmith can duplicate most keys.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>My hardware store no longer provides key replacement service. What should I do now?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Occasionally, a store will stop offering this service due to lack of demand or time constraints. In this case, we suggest calling a locksmith who is used to handling this type of request. To save time, always call ahead to ensure that your particular store provides these types of services.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>I have a combination lock that has a keyway in the front or the back. Is it possible to get a key for my lock?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                These locks are registered to a particular business or school and the keys are reserved for their use only.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, it is possible to purchase up to 12 additional keys if you are the registered end user (i.e. a school or institution). Send us a fax on your official letterhead requesting the keys you need. Be sure to include the exact key numbers and any information that will help us find your user registration. The cost is $3.99 per key plus a $5.00 flat fee for shipping, regardless of the number of keys being ordered. Fax your request to 1-800-308-9245, to the attention of Customer Service/Registered Keys.
            </p>
            <p>
                A remittance request will accompany your keys. Payment can be made by check or money order (at this time, credit card payments are not accepted).
            </p>

        </div>

        <h3>How can I get a new key for my lock if the locksmith or hardware store could not find a replacement?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                It is not always possible to get a replacement key for every model of lock. If your hardware store can not get one for you, please check with a local locksmith. If they are also unable to get a replacement, you may have to purchase a new lock.
            </p>
