                            To provide enhanced long–term security, Master Lock has discontinued imprinting a serial number on the lock body on combination locks sold through retail locations. For greater convenience, we encourage consumers to store their combination at our secure website, Masterlockvault.com, which is easy to use and offers 24/7 access. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide combinations for non–serialized locks. Please see <a href="/ContentFiles/Date_Codes_on_Combination_Locks.pdf" target="_blank">examples of a serial number</a> if you are unsure if your lock features one.

                                    Bring the lock to a Master Lock distributor or retailer. The lock must not be attached to anything.
                                    IMPORTANT: If the lock is not brought to the retailer or distributor, we will not release the combination.
                                    Ask the distributor or retailer to contact Master Lock for the combination on your behalf and we will validate ownership through them. US distributors may call 1-800-308-9244. Canadian distributors may call 1-800-227-9599.
                                    Please note that although Master Lock does not charge for this service, some distributors or retailers may charge a fee.

        <!-- Start 5th Question -->
        <h3>What is a Notary Public?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                A Notary Public is a state official authorized to witness the signing of important documents such as acknowledgements and jurats, administer oaths and affirmations, certify affidavits or depositions, and certain other powers as provided for by law. You can usually find a Notary at your bank and/or library (please call ahead).

        <h3>What should I do if I can't get a legible photocopy of my lock?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                We suggest that you lighten the copy as much as possible. If you can not read the serial number after you make the copy - that is ok, just write it on the side of the copy. What we need more importantly, is to clearly see that it is not attached to something.

                <li>
                    Turn the dial to the left, pass the first number of the sequence and stop on the second number.

        <div>
            <p>
                Resettable combination locks have a combination that is assigned by the owner of the lock. Therefore, Master Lock does not have record of the combination that the owner set. The lock cannot be reset unless it is in the open position. If your lock is attached to something, you will need to call a locksmith for removal. Please note that Master Lock does not reimburse for Locksmith services and/or fees.

        <h3>Can Master Lock reset my "Set-Your-Own" combination lock and send it back to me?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, your lock is a "set-your-own" combination lock. Once you have set the combination, we cannot reset it for you!

        <div>
            <p>
                Contact your local hardware store or locksmith. (Master Lock's part number for the reset tool is K175).

        <div>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, this lock is not resettable without knowing the combination that was assigned by the owner. It's most likely that you will need to purchase a new lock.
