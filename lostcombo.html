        <h3>Q: I've forgotten the combination to my standard dial combination lock. How do I obtain the combination for personal use?</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>My lock does not have a serial number
                    <div> To provide enhanced long–term security, Master Lock has discontinued imprinting a serial number on the lock body on combination locks sold through retail locations. For greater convenience, we encourage consumers to store their combination at our secure website, Masterlockvault.com, which is easy to use and offers 24/7 access. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide combinations for non–serialized locks. Please see </div>
                </li>

                <li>My lock has a serial number:
                    <div>
                        Please see examples of a serial number if you are unsure if your lock features one.
                        Choose from one of the two options below to obtain your combination:
                        Note: Due to increased security concerns nationwide, Master Lock recognizes the heightened need for additional safety measures. We no longer provide lock combinations in response to phone, fax, or email requests.
                    </div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Visit a Master Lock Distributor/Retailer
                            <div>
                                <p>Bring the lock to a Master Lock distributor or retailer. The lock must not be attached to anything.
                                IMPORTANT: If the lock is not brought to the retailer or distributor, we will not release the combination.
                                Ask the distributor or retailer to contact Master Lock for the combination on your behalf and we will validate ownership through them. US distributors may call 1-800-308-9244. Canadian distributors may call 1-800-227-9599.
                                Please note that although Master Lock does not charge for this service, some distributors or retailers may charge a fee.

                        <li>Submit a Lost Combination Form

                                <p>Confirm that your lock features a serial number prior to submitting a Lost Combination Form. Please see examples of a serial number if you are unsure if your lock features one.</p>
                                <p>Print out the Lost Combination Form from a <a href="http://content.masterlock.com/masterlock/resources/documents/html/lostcombo_form.html" target="_blank">Printer Friendly Page</a> or <a href="/ContentFiles/lost_combo_form.pdf" target="_blank">download the PDF file</a>. Have your Lost Combination Form notarized by a Notary Public to prove you are the owner of the lock. You can include up to 6 combinations on one notarized form. Note for inmates at a correctional facility: In addition to the Lost Combination Form, you must submit your request on official prison facility letterhead. In lieu of notarization, the Lost Combination Form must be signed by a prison facility official.</p>

        <h3>Q: Can I buy additional keys for my lock directly from Master Lock?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Master Lock does not provide keys directly to consumers; however, you may take one of your keys to a local hardware store, home center or locksmith where they can cut duplicate keys. Please note that not every store will have the appropriate key blanks available. Please call ahead.
