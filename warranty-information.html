        <h3>My lock does not function. Is it covered under warranty? Can the replacement lock be keyed and/or combined to the key or combination I currently have? What happens if the battery fails?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Master Lock offers a warranty on its padlocks, including key, combination, and electronic locks (including the battery) and the length of warranty is determined by the product number of your lock. (See limited lifetime warranty section below). Replacements to the same key, combinations, or electronic code are determined by the model lock being replaced. Customer Service will be able to verify that information at the time you make your warranty claim
