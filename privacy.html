                <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>
                <p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>
                <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
                <p>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 800778-2217 or email us at: <a href="mailto:help@masterlocks.com">help@masterlocks.com</a></p>
