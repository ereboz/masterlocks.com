            <h2>Have Confidence in Your Lock and Locker Selections!</h2>
            <h3>Dedicated to providing you with a problem free solution.</h3>
            <h4>Compatibility &amp; Quality Program</h4>
            <p>
                The compatibility between lock and locker must be seamless, especially when locks come from Master Lock
                and lockers from manufacturers. We have your solution- the Lock Locker Compatibility Program&trade;
            </p>
            <p>
                Master Lock, in partnership with the manufacturer, has developed an ongoing collaborative engineering and
                testing program, designed to help ensure the locker purchaser receives a high quality, seamless, locker
                locking solution.
            </p>
            <h4>Program Elements</h4>
            <h5>Compatibility Matrix Document</h5>
            <p>
                Participating locker manufacturers conduct annual updates to validate lock to locker fit. These test
                results are used to update and verify the compatibility matrix.
            </p>
            <h5>Periodic Production Spot Checks</h5>
            <p>
                Participating locker manufacturers perform periodic operation compatibility testing of locks on actual
                locker orders.
            </p>
            <h5>New Product Validation</h5>
            <p>
                Master Lock and locker manufacturers work together to ensure that new lock and locker products perform
                together as intended before installation, providing seamless locker locking.
            </p>
            <h5>Annual Design Conference</h5>
            <p>
                Master Lock and participating locker manufacturers meet to support, collaborate, and assist in continuous
                improvements.
            </p>
            <!--<div class="divider"></div>-->
            <p class="small-text">Locker manufacturers participating in this program have agreed to conduct
                lock-locker testing and work in collaboration with Master Lock. This does not guarantee specific
                security or durability standards. Locker purchasers should conduct their own evaluation of lock-locker

            <h2>Use the LLCP Compatibility Matrix</h2>
            <h3>Make Lock to Locker Selection Seamless</h3>
            <p>
                The LLCP Compatibility Matrix is a matrix developed annually by Locker Manufacturers and Master Lock that
                verifies which locks are compatible with which lockers. This is essential to preventing on-site
                compatibility problems and delays.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is how you can use the LLCP Compatibility Matrix:
            </p>
            <h4>Option A</h4>
            <p>
                The architect includes the <a href="/Templates/Hodge/docs/locker-lock-compatibility-program/LLCP_Architectural_Specification.pdf" target="_blank">LLCP
                Architectural Specification</a> in the job's specification package. By doing so, the contractor will
                then be required to consult the LLCP Compatibility Matrix to verify the appropriate lock for the job. As
                proof, the contractor will submit the Matrix with their bid package.
            </p>
            <p>-OR-</p>
            <h4>Option B</h4>
            <p>
                The architect directly consults the LLCP Compatibility Matrix to select the appropriate lock for the job
                and includes the appropriate lock in the job's specification package.
