These locks and lock boxes are designed in a way that prevents the threat of Bluetooth hacking that exists with some other Bluetooth products. To provide leading-edge security, we employ robust, military-grade authentication and encryption mechanisms built upon proven, NIST recommended and FIPS Approved algorithms to deter sniffing, replay and manipulation attempts that Bluetooth technology has been associated with. These mechanisms are regularly audited by independent security professionals.
