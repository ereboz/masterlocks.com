        <!-- Start Question 1 -->
        <h3>I bought some Master Lock door hardware a few years ago, and it's not functioning properly. How do I get it replaced?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                In December 1997, Master Lock sold off an older division which made door hardware products. However, we are still honoring the warranty. Please call 1-800-308-9244 for information regarding warranty.
            </p>
            <span class="note">
                    <span class="bold">Note: </span> the lock is set, there is no way to open it without the combination. Please make sure you record your NEW combination in a safe place.
            </span>
            <p>
                If you purchased Master Lock door hardware products after March 2, 2006, you can find more information regarding these products at <a class="highlight" href="http://www.masterdoorlock.com/">www.masterdoorlocks.com</a>. Master Lock door hardware products are also sold at select stores nationwide.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 1 -->

        <!-- Start Question 2 -->
        <h3>Can I purchase locksets that are already keyed alike?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Yes, most stores carry locksets that are available with the keyed alike capability. Keyed alike means that one key will open multiple doors providing added convenience for the home owner. Your key code can be found on the Master Lock package.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 2 -->

        <!-- Start Question 3 -->
        <h3>Can one key open all my door locks?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Many retailers and most locksmiths can convert all of your door locks to operate from the same key.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 3 -->

        <!-- Start Question 4 -->
        <h3>If my lock is broken, should I repair or replace it?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                In most circumstances, a broken lock cannot be repaired. For personal safety and security, you should always replace your broken lock with a new one.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 4 -->

        <!-- Start Question 5 -->
        <h3>How much time will it take to install new locks?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Simply by using a Phillips head screwdriver, most individuals can replace their existing locks in just 10-15 minutes each.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 5 -->

        <!-- Start Question 6 -->
        <h3>Which grade of door lock offers the best security for my home?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Industry experts agree that a Grade 2 NightWatch® deadbolt with a 1' bolt is the ideal choice for home security. For maximum protection, deadbolts are recommended on all entry doors including front, rear, and side entrances as well as any walk-in doors leading to your garage.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 6 -->

        <!-- Start Question 7 -->
        <h3>What is the difference between Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3 door hardware?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The ANSI grading system is a voluntary standard widely used within the door hardware industry, and is designed to determine the durability and level of security provided by the lock.
            </p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><span class="bold">Grade 1: </span>commercial quality door locks most commonly used in heavy traffic commercial buildings.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Grade 2: </span>light commercial use and heavy residential use.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Grade 3: </span>standard residential security.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 7 -->

        <!-- Start Question 8 -->
        <h3>Why can I open my locked front door with just a credit card in 3 seconds?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                This problem is caused by a misaligned strike plate. Keyed entry locks use what is referred to as a dead–locking "dog". If you were to look at the end of the latch, you will see two spring loaded bolts. The first is large and tapered and is intended to spring through the strike plate. The smaller flat bolt is the "dog".
            </p>
            <p>
                For proper operation, the strike plate needs to be aligned such that the dog does not pass through the strike plate opening. if it does, the latch can be worked back with a credit card or screw driver. If the dog stops on the strike plate, the latch cannot be worked back. It is then "deadlocked" into position. Realigning the strike plate should alleviate the problem.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 8 -->

        <!-- Start Question 9 -->
        <h3>How do I know if my door is right–handed or left–handed?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                To determine the Handing of a door face the OUTSIDE of the door.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 9 -->

        <!-- Start Question 10 -->
        <h3>I have Master Lock door hardware that was purchased prior to 2004 that requires warranty services. What should I do?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The phone number for warranty claims on door hardware produced prior to 2004 is 1–800–366–7565.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 10 -->

        <!-- Start Question 11 -->
        <h3>I would like to replace my Master Lock handleset that was purchased prior to 2004. Will your current handlesets retrofit the holes in my door?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                There were a variety of handlesets produced by Master Lock. The current styles have an 8 13/32" distance between the handleset bore, and the lower mounting screw. If your current handleset has a different dimension, you will need to plug the current hole and re-drill.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 11 -->

        <!-- Start Question 12 -->
        <h3>How do I remove the knob and rosette to access the mounting screws?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                Insert the included tool into the hole in the rosette and depress the pin at the base of the knob. Then pull the knob off. The rosette can be un-snapped from the mounting plate by either pulling the tab, or carefully prying. Reverse the procedure for installation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 12 -->

        <!-- Start Question 13 -->
        <h3>After installing my deadbolt, why does it not work correctly?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                It is critical that the deadbolt tailpiece be horizontal when inserted into the retracted bolt during installation. In addition, the dimple in the thumbturn shaft must be pointed downward for proper Nightwatch operation.
            </p>
