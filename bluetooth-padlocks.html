        <h3>I replaced the battery in my lock. Why does the app still show the low battery icon?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                After installing a new battery, the low battery icon will no longer display in the app, after the app and the lock communicate with each other. However, it will take 2 to 24 hours on the Indoor Padlock (4400), and 2 to 72 hours on the Outdoor Padlock (4401), for the yellow LED to stop displaying on the lock itself.

                Your Guest can access the lock without a Bluetooth enabled device by entering a Manual Code on the lock keypad.

        <h3>Can the 4401 series be used outdoors?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The 4401 series is designed for outdoor use. It features a full 2-piece injection molded body cover, elastomer shackle seals and weather protected internal components.
            </p>

        <!-- End Question 8 -->

        <!-- Start Question 9 -->
        <h3>My 4401 outdoor lock lights green but the lock won’t unlock. How do I unlock it?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                If the lock is in Touch Unlock mode, push the top of the metal shackle firmly down into the lock body to ensure proper mechanical engagement. Then, press any button on the lock and it should light blue and unlock, resuming normal operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the lock is in Swipe Unlock mode, push the top of the metal shackle firmly down into the lock body to ensure proper mechanical engagement. The app should change to blue to show as locked and then display the swipe arrow prompts to unlock the lock, resuming normal operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are trying to unlock using a directional manual code on the lock keypad, push the top of the metal shackle firmly down into the lock body to ensure proper mechanical engagement. Then, enter the manual code on the lock keypad. It should light blue and unlock, resuming normal operation.

        <h3>The keypad on my 4401DLH outdoor lock has frozen so the buttons cannot be pressed. What should I do?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                If moisture on the lock keypad freezes so that a button cannot be pressed, we recommend warming the lock keypad between gloved hands for a short time to melt the ice until the button can be pressed. The lock should then resume normal operation.
            </p>
        </div>
        <!-- End Question 10 -->

        <h3>My lock will not relock. What should I do?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                This can occur if the lock shackle is closed and opened again quickly before the motor has time to relock the lock. Press any button on the lock keypad and when the lock lights green, close the lock and it will light blue when locked.
